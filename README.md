## Vite React Project
This project is a simple web application built with **Vite** and **React** that allows users to perform and display transactions. The application consists of two main components:

- TransactionForm: A form that allows users to input transaction details (name, value, and description).

- TransactionDisplay: A component that displays the list of transactions stored in the browser's local storage.
